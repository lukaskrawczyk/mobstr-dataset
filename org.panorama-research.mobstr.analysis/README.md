# Analysis Results for the MobSTr dataset

This folder contains analysis results that were derived from the Amalthea model in the "[`org.panorama-research.mobstr.amalthea`](../org.panorama-research.mobstr.amalthea)" folder using static analysis techniques. The analysis artifacts were generated by a set of cloud-based analysis tools (DSE-Analysis and Model-Analysis), that will be published in the near future.

* [`dse_analysis`](dse_analysis): Contains a series of timing metrics related to the 18 **(sub-)tasks** and 5 **task chains** of the model. Metrics related to tasks consist of lower and upper bounds on execution times and response times, as well as an indicator whether deadlines were missed. For task-chains, the metrics quantify the so-called reaction latency for two communication paradigms: **Implicit Communication**, which assumes that data is transferred at a task's start/response point; and **LET Communication**, which assumes that data is transferred at period boundaries. For an in depth description of the metrics along with the static analysis techniques that were used in obtaining them, we refer to publications [1,2]. 
  * [`dse_analysis/results.json`](dse_analysis/results.json): Contains timing analysis metrics in a machine-readable format (JSON). The fields `lTransactionResult` and `lExecutableResult` are used to store all metrics related to **tasks** and **sub-tasks** respectively. Metrics related to **task chains** are found under `lEventChainResult`.
  * [`dse_analysis/_dse_interpreter/_chart_visualizer/charts.html`](dse_analysis/_dse_interpreter/_chart_visualizer/charts.html): Illustrates a convenient (human-readable) visualization of the timing analysis results (HTML)
* [`model_analysis/_chart_visualizer/charts.html`](model_analysis/_chart_visualizer/charts.html): Visualization of so-called label access metrics, e.g. the number of times variables are accessed by each individual processing unit and process, the type of access (read, write, both), and a histogram illustrating the distribution of variable sizes.
